    * config.h.in, configure.ac, AUTHORS, src/commands.c,
      src/dfu.c, src/dfu-device.h, src/dfu.h, src/main.c:
      Added the patch Torsten Rottmann sent to enable
      libusb 1.0 support, plus I some changes to allow for
      switching via a configure file flag.

2010-02-15 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt@alumni.purdue.edu>
    * src/arguments.c, src/arguments.h, dfu-programmer.1,

2009-08-13 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt@alumni.purdue.edu>
    * src/arguments.c, src/arguments.h, src/atmel.c,
      src/commands.c: Fixed the broken state that the AVR
      devices were in due to not selecting the correct memory
      page prior to flashing.  Broke apart the
      eeprom/flash/user page flashing/dumping into separate
      functions so the maintenance will be easier.  Cleaned
      up the address ranges so they are consistent across
      memory types.  Fixed some debug statements that should
      have been going to stderr instead of stdout that made
      the output of a dump garbled.  Cleaned up some more
      off by 1 errors that were in the dump functionality.
      Verified my changes on my AVR32 and AVR boards.

2009-05-31 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt@alumni.purdue.edu>
    * src/atmel.c: Fix a memory address identification bug
      that would cause the value 0xff to not be recognized.
    * src/commands.c, AUTHORS: Applied the patch that Xavier
      Leprevost created to allow dumping avr32 user flash
      properly.

2009-05-23 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt@alumni.purdue.edu>
    * src/atmel.c: Fix a buffer overrun error that would
      cause a core dump sometimes.

2009-04-30 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt@alumni.purdue.edu>
    * src/arguments.c, src/arguments.h, src/atmel.c,
      src/atmel.h, src/commands.c, AUTHORS: Applied the
      patch from Zachary Clifford to enable all the AVR32
      fuses to be set or gotten (all BOD fuse setting is
      disabled for device safety since they can brick your
      device.)

2009-04-29 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt@alumni.purdue.edu>
    * src/arguments.c, src/atmel.c: Fix the off by one issue
      Brad pointed out for blank checking.  Fix a bug in the
      blank checking for devices with greater than 65k of
      memory that were not AVR32 based, so that all the
      memory is checked, not just a portion of the lower bytes.

2009-04-28 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt@alumni.purdue.edu>
    * src/arguments.c, src/arguments.h, src/commands.c: Fix
      a memory overlap issue between the bootloader & the
      flash memory available for the new firmware.
    * AUTHORS: Added Brad Schick to the list of contributers.

2009-04-27 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt@alumni.purdue.edu>

2008-10-31 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt@alumni.purdue.edu>
    * src/*, AUTHORS, fedora/dfu-programmer.spec.in,
      docs/dfu-programmer.1: Apply Zachary Clifford patch to
      add more support for AVR32 devices & merged the two
      together.
    * src/*: Fixed a number of off-by-one errors that were
      all over the place.

2008-10-02 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt@alumni.purdue.edu>
    * src/atmel.c: Enable chip erase, blank checking and
      reading from flash for the AVR32 devices.

2008-10-01 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt@alumni.purdue.edu>
    * src/*, fedora/10-dfu-programmer.fdi: Change the
      parameters to use a struct instead of passing the usb
      information as separate parameters.  Additionally
      cleaned up some of the code to make the way for AVR32
      support & added very basic identification support.

2008-09-26 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt@alumni.purdue.edu>
    * src/arguments.c, AUTHORS: Fixed PID values for the
      at90usb82 and at90usb182 chips based on Peter's findings.

      src/commands.c, AUTHORS: Applied the patch that Geoffrey
      Wossum provided to add a reset command.
    * fedora/*: Adding udev rules for and permissions so that
      the console owner will automatically be able to flash
      any of the devices supported by dfu-programmer.
    * dfu-programmer.spec.in, Makefile.am, configure.ac:
      Moved the spec file into the fedora specific

2007-04-25 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt AT alumni.purdue.edu>

    * docs/dfu-programmer.1: Added a KNOWN ISSUES section,
      updated the BUGS section, and corrected the Free
      Software Foundation address.
    * src/arguments.c: Adjusted the memory sizes for the at90
      series of chips so they can take advantage of the entire
      amount of flash memory.
    * src/atmel.c, src/atmel.h: Add the concept and support for
      paged flash memory.  I added this so that only devices
      that actually go into paged memory will try to make calls
      to the memory paging routine.  I also did a bit of cleanup
      to allow a clean transition between the pages (so there
      are not regions of memory being flashed that overlap a
      flash memory page boundary).

    * configure.ac: Incremented the release number
    * NEWS: Updated the latest news about the 0.4.0 release
    * src/arguments.c, src/arguments.h: add two fields to the
      chip configuration structures to handle the two
      inconsistencies in the dfu firmware - the at90 chips
      need to be aborted initially, and the at90 chips don't
      return valid interface class and subclass information.
      Originally, the interface problem was thought to be
      related to OS X, but it now looks like it is the chipset.
    * src/dfu.c, src/dfu.h, src/main.c: add the handing of
      the new initial abort and interface class/subclass workarounds.

2007-01-16 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt AT alumni.purdue.edu>

    * src/intel_hex.c: change the sscanf() parameter to an int
      from a char to be compliant with the sscanf() %x documentation
      stating that the output of %x is an int.

2007-01-14 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt AT alumni.purdue.edu>

    * src/arguments.c: added the flash_page_size data and values
      to the data structure.  I checked to make sure that the
      flash page size is correct for all of the processors.
    * src/arguments.h: added the flash_page_size data member to
      the programmer_arguments data structure.
    * src/atmel.c: updated the atmel_flash() functionality so that
      only the memory pages that need to be flashed are flashed.
    * src/atmel.h: updated the external interface for atmel_flash()
      to refelect the changes in src/atmel.c
    * src/commands.c: changed the passing of the argument structure
      to be a pointer instead of the actual full structure.
      Updated the execute_flash() functionality to support the
      changes made in src/atmel.x.
    * src/commands.h: updated the function prototype.
    * src/intel_hex.c: changed the processing of the hex strutures
      to allow the support of only flashing the memory locations
      that are actually programmed.
    * src/intel_hex.h: updated the function prototypes.
    * src/main.c: pass the pointer to the argument structure instead
      of passing the entire structure.

2007-01-07 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt AT alumni.purdue.edu>

    * AUTHORS: added Markus Schneider for his OS X contributions
    * configure.ac: changed AC_CONFIG_HEADER to AM_CONFIG_HEADER
      to allow easier compiling on OS X.
    * src/dfu.c: added a workaround for OS X because it was
      not finding devices since the DFU interface information
      is not being correctly reported.

2007-01-06 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt AT alumni.purdue.edu>

    * config.h.in: added the autogenerated information from
      autoheader.
    * configure.ac: added checking for errno.h stdarg.h and
      stddef.h to be more thorough in checking for required
      headers.
    * src/dfu.c: added an #ifdef around the EREMOTEIO case
    * src/intel_hex.c: refactored intel_read_data() to not
      use getline(), but to simply walk the file via fgets()
      and fgetc().  As it turns out, getline() wasn't really
      adding much value.

2006-11-28 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt AT alumni.purdue.edu>

    * src/atmel.c: remove the dfu_make_idle() calls
    * src/dfu.c: large changes to allow the dfu module to
      discover and acquire the usb device.  This change was
      required to allow the dfu module to try to transition
      a USB device from its runtime mode into its DFU mode.
      Part of this transition requires resetting, re-enumerating,
      and re-acquiring the device.  All of this was not possible
      before because the main function held onto the device
      and it's handle.  Additionally, when acquiring the device
      for the first time, the dfu module tries to put the device
      into the correct state, instead of punting this process
      to the later steps, when it is impossible to recover from.
      Finally, the variables named "device" were changed to be
      "handle" since that's what they really are and there are
      references to the actual "device" structure in dfu.c now.
    * src/dfu.h: updated the prototypes to reflect the changes in
      dfu.c.
    * src/main.c: remove the dfu_make_idle() calls and simplify
      the main function since most of the work is now being done
      in dfu.c.  Additionally, move the device discovery to dfu.c

2006-11-19 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt AT alumni.purdue.edu>

    * src/atmel.c: Added the dfu_make_idle() call before
      operations that communicate with the device being flashed.
      This should make the communications more reliable as it
      puts the device in a known state.  Additionally, I added
      some better error messages in the hopes that it will be
      easier to diagnose the problem when commands to the
      device fail.  Finally, I adjusted the return code checking
      for dfu_get_statue() to reflect the new interface of 0 for
      success or < 0 for errors.
    * src/commands.c: I fixed a poor error message.
    * src/dfu.c: I updated the dfu_get_status() function to simply
      return 0 on a success, or < 0 on an error.  I added
      dfu_make_idle() to allow the device to be put in a known
      state or to force an early bailout.
    * src/dfu.h: dfu_make_idle() is publically available.

    * src/dfu.c: Added a DFU status to string conversion method
      and when debug is enabled, dfu_get_status() shows both the
      string and the number for the status.
    * src/dfu.h: the dfu_status_to_string() is made publically
      available.

    * src/atmel.c: Remove the init function since it is no longer
      needed.  This re-works the debug message support so there is
      a simple macro DEBUG() that takes care of all the work.
      Additionally, this fixes an erasing problem where when the
      entire chip was supposed to be erased, it was not.  This
      could cause problems because when the security bits are set,
      they could never be unset.
    * src/atmel.h: Remove the init function since it is no longer
      needed.
    * src/commands.c: This re-works the debug message support so
      there is a simple macro DEBUG() that takes care of all the
      work.
    * src/dfu.c: This re-works the debug message support so there
      is a simple macro DEBUG() that takes care of all the work.
      Additionally, there is no reason to have the init function
      since we are going to use the one external debug variable.
      This normalized all of the functions so they produce useful
      information when debug messages are enabled.  Finally, this
      adds an error number to message converter so that tracking
      down errors is a bit easier.
    * src/dfu.h: Remove the init & debug functions.
    * src/main.c: Adjust the level needed to turn the libusb
      debugging messages on.  Removed the atmel_init() call.
    * src/Makefile.am: Added util.c and util.h to be built.
    * src/util.c: Added the dfu_debug() function in a common
      location.
    * src/util.h: Added the dfu_debug() function in a common
      location.

    * dfu-programmer.spec.in: This resolves several of the problems
      present in the spec file.  The goal is to be able to make this
      package part of the fedora extras.
    * configure.ac: Incremented the release number
    * NEWS: Updated the latest news about the 0.3.1 release
    * docs/dfu-programmer.1: Update the SEE ALSO section, AUTHOR
      section and added the copyright information.

2006-06-24 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt AT alumni.purdue.edu>

    * dfu-programmer.spec.in: Update the supported chips
    * NEWS: Updated the latest news about the 0.3.0 release
    * src/arguments.c: Adjusted the 8051 based chip memory sizes to
      be accurate, and the top memory address is calculated based off
      of the memory size.
    * src/arguments.h: Added top_memory_address to differentiate the
      memory size and top memory address.  This resolves my question
      about the +1 offset.
    * src/atmel.c: Fix a bug where the last byte of memory was not being
      transferred from the device for validation purposes.
    * src/commands.c: Updated to use memory_size and top_memory_address
      depending on which value is needed, instead of using one value
      to serve both purposes.

2006-06-24 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt AT alumni.purdue.edu>

    * dfu-programmer.spec.in: Update the supported chips
    * README: Added an instruction about building the source from CVS.

2006-06-19 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt AT alumni.purdue.edu>

    * AUTHORS: Updated David Brownell's contributions - which makes
      up almost this entire check-in!
    * configure.ac: Incremented the release number
    * NEWS: Updated the latest news about the 0.3.0 release
    * src/arguments.c: Added the new targets, made the target names
      case insensitive, added a version command line "command", updated
      the mechanism for matching commands, and updated debugging output.
    * src/arguments.h: Added new targets, and cleaned the arguments
      structure up a bit.
    * src/atmel.c: Applied general cleanup, matched the atmel.h
      interfaces and added an AVR a configuration reading function.
    * src/atmel.h: Updated the interface to allow for 8051 vs AVR
      differences.  This also starts the use of stdint.h values.
    * src/commands.c: Updated to a more standard debugging system and
      added command checking for 8051 vs AVR differences.  There is
      an open question about why we switch between args.memory_size
      and args.memory_size+1 in comparisons.  I need to re-read up
      on why in the world I did args.memory_size+1 in the first
      place, then follow up with David about implications around
      the AVR chips.
    * src/dfu.c: Updated to a more standard debugging system and
      removed an overly verbose debug message.
    * src/intel_hex.c: Added comments about the record types, and
      added 20 bit address types for the larger amount of addressable
      flash memory.
    * src/main.c: Updated to a more standard debugging system,
      updated the failure messages to include the package information.
    * README: Updated description and list of supported chips

    * AUTHORS: Added David Brownell as a contributor.
    * configure: Removed because it is generated by bootstrap.sh
    * Makefile.in: Removed because it is generated
    * docs/Makefile.in: Removed because it is generated
    * src/Makefile.in: Removed because it is generated
    * src/Makefile.am: Applied David Brownell's patch that adds -Wall
      as a compiler option.

    * AUTHORS: Updated my email address
    * configure.ac: Incremented the release number
    * dfu-programmer.spec.in: Update the release to Fedora Core 5
    * NEWS: Updated the latest news about the 0.2.2 release
    * src/main.c: Fix the failure cases so that if the USB interface was
      not acquired then it is not errantly released.

2005-11-21 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt AT alumni.purdue.edu>

    * configure.ac: Incremented the release number
    * NEWS: Updated the latest news about the 0.2.1 release

2005-11-21 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt AT alumni.purdue.edu>

    * docs/dfu-programmer.1: Bring the man page in-line with the
      built in help, plus a bit more info.

2005-11-21 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt AT alumni.purdue.edu>

    * src/main.c: Two minor fixes to allow it to work with newer 2.6.xx
      kernels.  The first had to do with using a function call to get
      the buses to iterate over, and the second has to do with not
      setting a configuration.  Apparently this doesn't need to be done.

2005-09-24 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt AT yahoo.com>

    * configure.ac: Incremented the release number
    * NEWS: Updated the latest news about the 0.2.0 release
    * src/commands.c: Removed the hard-coded restrictions on sizes and
      instead malloc the space needed.  Additionally the size is gotten
      from the arguments data structure, so that adding future devices
      should be easier.
    * src/arguments.h: Added memory_size to the programmer_arguments
      data structure.  Restructured the targets_enum so that it can
      be used as keys into the target_map data structure for target
      to name resolution without needing to duplicate data.
    * src/arguments.c: Made the changes needed to take advantage of the
      memory size restructuring and changed the usage() function to
      use iteration instead of duplication to display supported chips

2005-09-24 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt AT yahoo.com>

    * src/{*.c,*.h}, AUTHORS: removed the copyright information from the
      file so that the AUTHORS file can manage this information for the
      entire project

2005-09-24 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt AT yahoo.com>

    * src/{arguments.c,arguments.h,atmel.c,commands.c}: applied
      Reinhard Arlt's patch that adds support for the at89c5131 chip
